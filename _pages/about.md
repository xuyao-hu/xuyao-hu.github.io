I'm a theoretical physicist, currently a PhD candidate at New York University.
My current research focuses on Quantum Gravity, Quantum Field Theory, and Quantum Chaos.

I will be completing my PhD at New York University in 2023, supervised by [Matthew Kleban](https://cosmo.nyu.edu/index.php/people/information/?userid=9Lzn5tSgPg). Throughout my graduate studies, I have focused primarily on three areas: nonperturbative effects in Quantum Field Theory using lattice gauge theory simulation and worldline formalism; classical and quantum aspects of chaos and turbulence; and de Sitter holography.

More recently, I'm exploring double-scaled Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (DSSYK) model and its possible connection to quantum gravity.
